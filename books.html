                        on the brink of war, and Gregor's arrival is no accident.

                        he swears he will never go back. But he is destined to be a key player in another prophecy, this
                        one about an ominous white rat called the Bane. The Underlanders know there is only one way to
                        lure Gregor back to their world: by kidnapping his little sister, Boots.

                        With two prophecies fulfilled, Gregor is now focused on the Prophecy of Blood, which calls for
                        Gregor and "the princess," Boots, to return to the Underland to help ward off a plague. His mom
                        agrees to let them go - on the condition that she travels with them.When they arrive in the
                        subterranean city, the plague is spreading--and one of Gregor's family is stricken.

                        Gregor is drawn into a crisis. For generations, rats have run the mice--or "nibblers"--out of
                        whatever lands they've claimed, keeping them on the move. But now the mice are disappearing, and
                        the young queen Luxa is determined to find out why.

                        Everyone in the Underland has been taking great pains to keep The Prophecy of Time from
                        Gregor. Gregor suspected it says something awful but he never imagined just how awful: It calls
                        for
                        the warrior's death. Now, with an army of rats approaching and his mom and sister still in
                        Regalia, Gregor the warrior must gather up his courage to help defend Regalia and get his family
                        home
                        safely.
