            <p>
                In 1991, Suzanne Collins began her career writing for children's TV, contributing to several Nickelodeon
                shows like "Clarissa Explains it All" and "The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo." She also wrote for "Little
                Bear" and "Oswald," co-wrote the holiday special "Santa, Baby!" and later became Head Writer for
                "Clifford's Puppy Days" and worked on "Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!" Her meeting with James Proimos while working
                on "Generation O!" led her to children's books.

                Her first book series, "The Underland Chronicles," started with "Gregor the Overlander," inspired by
                urban life contrasts to "Alice in Wonderland." It was a New York Times bestseller and sold in 21 foreign
                territories. Her next series, "The Hunger Games Trilogy," achieved international acclaim, staying on the
                New York Times bestseller list for over six years, sold in 54 territories, and adapted into successful
                films by Lionsgate. In 2010, TIME named her one of the world's most influential people. In 2016, she
                received the Authors Guild Award for her significant impact on young readers.

                She also released "YEAR OF THE JUNGLE," an autobiographical picture book in 2013, and "WHEN CHARLIE
                MCBUTTON LOST POWER," a children's book about a tech-obsessed boy, in 2005.

                In 1991, Suzanne Collins began her professional career writing for children's television. She worked on
                the staffs of several Nickelodeon shows, including the Emmy-nominated hit Clarissa Explains it All and
                The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo. For preschool viewers, she penned multiple stories for the
                Emmy-nominated Little Bear and Oswald. She also co-wrote the Rankin/Bass Christmas special, Santa, Baby!
                with her friend, Peter Bakalian, which was nominated for a WGA Award in Animation. Most recently she was
                the Head Writer for Scholastic Entertainment's Clifford's Puppy Days,and a freelancer on Wow! Wow!
                Wubbzy! While working on a Kids WB show called Generation O! she met children's author and illustrator
                James Proimos, who talked her into giving children's books a try.

                Thinking one day about Alice in Wonderland, she was struck by how pastoral the setting must seem to kids
                who, like her own, lived in urban surroundings. In New York City, you're much more likely to fall down a
                manhole than a rabbit hole and, if you do, you're not going to find a tea party. What you might find...?
                Well, that's the story of Gregor the Overlander, the first book in her five-part fantasy/war series, The
                Underland Chronicles,which became a New York Times bestseller. It has been sold into 21 foreign
                territories.
            </p>
            <p>
                Her next series, The Hunger Games Trilogy, is an international bestseller. The Hunger Games has spent
                over six years to date on The New York Times bestseller list since publication in September 2008, and
                has also appeared consistently on USA Today and Publishers Weekly bestseller lists. It has been sold
                into 54 territories in 52 languages. In 2010 Suzanne was named to the TIME 100 list as well as the
                Entertainment Weekly Entertainers of the Year list. In 2016, she was presented the 2016 Authors Guild
                Award for Distinguished Service to the Literary Community for exemplifying the unique power of young
                people's literature to change lives and create lifelong book lovers. It was the first time the Guild
                presented the award to a YA author.
